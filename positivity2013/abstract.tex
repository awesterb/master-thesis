\talktitle	{Lattice Valuations\\ A Generalisation of Measure and Integral}
\printtitleinfo

The (Lebesgue) measure and integral are two closely related,
but distinct objects of study.
Nonetheless,
they are both real-valued \emph{lattice valuations}:
order preserving real-valued functions~$\varphi$
on a lattice~$L$
which are \emph{modular}, i.e.,
\begin{equation*}
\varphi(x) + \varphi(y) 
\,=\, 
\varphi(x\wedge y) + \varphi(x\vee y)\qquad(x,y\in L).
\end{equation*}
We unify measure and integral
by developing a theory for lattice valuations.
We allow these lattice valuations
to take their values from the reals,
or any suitable ordered Abelian group.
