\begin{abstract}
In analysis,
measure and integral are two fundamental
and distinct
objects of study.
They
 are both real-valued \emph{lattice valuations}:
an order preserving real-valued function~$f$
on a lattice~$L$
which is \emph{modular},
\begin{equation*}
f(x) + f(y) \,=\, f(x\wedge y) + f(x\vee y)\qquad(x,y\in L).
\end{equation*}
In this thesis,
we unify measure and integral
by developing the Analytic theory of lattice valuations,
which take their values from the reals,
or any suitable Abelian ordered group.
