\begin{abstract}
In analysis,
measure and integral are two closely related,
but distinct objects of study.
Nonetheless,
they are both real-valued \emph{lattice valuations}:
order preserving real-valued functions~$\varphi$
on a lattice~$L$
which are \emph{modular}, i.e.,
\begin{equation*}
\varphi(x) + \varphi(y) 
\,=\, 
\varphi(x\wedge y) + \varphi(x\vee y)\qquad(x,y\in L).
\end{equation*}

we unify measure and integral
by developing the analytic theory of lattice valuations.
We allow these lattice valuations
to take their values from the reals,
or any suitable ordered Abelian group.

\section*{Foreword}
In the summer of 2009, Bas Westerbaan,
and I worked out an 
overly general approach
to the introduction of the Lebesgue measure and the Lebesgue integral
with the help of dr.~A.C.M.~van~Rooij.
The theory I present in this thesis,
is based on the work done in that sumnmer.

Since I was fortunate enough to be offered
a PHD-position,
this thesis has been written under time constraints.
Hence the text is not nearly as polished as 
I would like it to be,
and the proofs of some statements
have been left to the reader.
I hope the reader will be able to ignore the rough edges
and enjoy this fresh view on the old subject
of measure and integration.

I would like to thank my all my teachers
for showing me the beauty of mathematics.
In particular, I would like to thank
dr.~Mai Gehrke for showing me the beauty of abstract reasoning.
I thank dr.~Wim Veldman for making me
see the available content of mathematics more clearly,
and with it the difficulties
of \emph{both} the platonic and formalist views.
I am grateful to dr.~Henk Barendregt
for his advise on the writing of mathematics.
The most gratitude I am indebted
to dr.~A.C.M.~van~Rooij,
for the beautifull exposition of 
the theory of measure and integration
he has shown me,
for all the time he spend 
answering my questions
while supervising this thesis and before,
and above all,
for his never relenting willingness
to note my errors.
