\begin{abstract}
In analysis,
measure and integral are two closely related,
but distinct objects of study.
Nontheless,
they are both real-valued \emph{lattice valuations}:
an order preserving real-valued function~$\varphi$
on a lattice~$L$
which is \emph{modular}, i.e.,
\begin{equation*}
\varphi(x) + \varphi(y) 
\,=\, 
\varphi(x\wedge y) + \varphi(x\vee y)\qquad(x,y\in L).
\end{equation*}
In this thesis,
we unify measure and integral
by developing the Analytic theory of lattice valuations.
We allow these lattice valuations
to take their values from the reals,
or any suitable ordered Abelian group.
